Abstract
This project evaluates whether combining a feedforward neural network and a radial basis function or linear support vector machine will help the prediction of breast cancer survivability. Breast cancer survivability is how long the patient survives after their initial diagnosis, and understanding survivability is crucial to aiding healthcare physicians in providing both effective and efficient treatment plans to patients. Previous papers have addressed this problem by using machine learning methods such as neural networks and support vector machines as individual algorithms, but this project investigates whether combining these two methods will improve the accuracy of survivability prediction. While the results of this project did not show benefits or an increased accuracy from combining a support vector machine with a neural network, a smaller standard deviation of model performances was shown in the radial basis support vector machine combined with neural network.
